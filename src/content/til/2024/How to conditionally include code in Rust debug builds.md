description: "Today I learned that in Rust, you can use the `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` attribute to conditionally include a field in a struct only during debug builds, allowing for development-specific features without affecting release builds."
---

You can use conditional compilation attributes (`#[cfg(...)]`) to conditionally include a field based on whether you’re building in debug mode. In typical Cargo-based Rust projects, the `debug_assertions` configuration predicate is enabled in debug builds and disabled in release builds.

Here’s an example:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStruct {
    always_present: i32,
    
    #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
    debug_only: String,
}
```

**How This Works:**

- **`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`**: This attribute is true when compiling in debug mode (e.g., `cargo build`), and false during release builds (e.g., `cargo build --release`).
- When `debug_assertions` is active, the `debug_only` field will be included in the struct. In a release build, that field will be completely omitted from the struct definition.

**Important Notes:**

1. **Struct layout changes:** Because the field is included only in debug builds, the memory layout of `MyStruct` changes between debug and release modes. If you rely on a stable binary interface (e.g., passing this struct across FFI boundaries), you need to ensure consistency. Usually, this isn’t a problem if you’re only using the struct internally.
    
2. **Derived trait implementations:** If you have derived traits like `Debug` or `Clone`, they will also adapt accordingly. For `Debug`, it simply won’t print `debug_only` in release mode because the field isn’t there at all.

In summary, `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` is the simplest and most idiomatic solution to conditionally include a field only in debug builds.
