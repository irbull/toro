- Arm circles (small → big, forward & backward)
    
- Torso twists
    
- Walking lunges with reach
    
- Quick feet in place → athletic stance freeze

## 10:00–25:00 — Throwing Progression (Pairs)

**Purpose:** Build arm safety and clean mechanics before distance.

### Progression (5 min each)

1. **Wrist snaps (5–7 m)**
    
    - One knee or standing
        
    - Focus on spin and follow-through
        
2. **Kneeling throws**
    
    - Glove-side knee down
        
    - Elbow up, smooth release
        
3. **Standing short throws**
    
    - Step → throw
        
    - Emphasize accuracy, not speed
        
4. **Controlled extension**
    
    - Back up only if throws are clean
        
    - No max-effort throws today
        

📌 **Coach cues**
