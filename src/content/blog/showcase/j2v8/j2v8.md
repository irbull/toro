## Overview

J2V8 is a set of Java bindings for V8. J2V8 focuses on performance and tight integration with V8. It also takes a 'primitive first' approach, meaning that if a value can be accessed as a primitive, then it should be. This forces a more static type system between the JS and Java code, but it also improves the performance since intermediate Objects are not created.

We developed J2V8 as a high performance engine for our multi-platform mobile toolkit [tabris.js](https://tabrisjs.com/) and it is a great choice for executing JavaScript on Android devices.
