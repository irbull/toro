## Instructions

1. **Preheat and Prep:**  
   - Adjust your oven rack to the upper-middle position.  
   - Preheat oven to 425°F.  
   - Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top. Spray the rack with non-stick spray.

2. **Dry the Wings:**  
   - Pat the wings very dry with paper towels.  
   - Place them in a large bowl.

3. **Season the Wings:**  
   - In a small bowl, mix together baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.  
   - Sprinkle the seasoning over the wings, tossing to coat evenly.

4. **Bake:**  
   - Arrange the wings skin side up in a single layer on the prepared rack.  
   - Bake, turning every 20 minutes, until the wings are crispy and browned (may take up to 1 hour, depending on size).

5. **Make the Buffalo Sauce (if using):**  
   - In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together Frank’s Hot Wings Sauce, brown sugar, and water.  
   - Stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.

6. **Finish and Serve:**  
   - Let the baked wings rest for 5 minutes.  
   - Toss them in your chosen sauce or serve sauce on the side.
