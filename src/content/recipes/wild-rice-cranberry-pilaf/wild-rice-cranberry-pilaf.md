#### **Instructions**

1. **Cook the Wild Rice Blend**
    
    - Rinse the wild rice blend under cold water to remove excess starch.
    - In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a boil. Stir in the rice blend, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–30 minutes (or according to package instructions) until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
    - Remove from heat, fluff with a fork, and set aside.
2. **Sauté the Vegetables**
    
    - Heat olive oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
    - Add the onion, carrot, and celery, and sauté for 5–7 minutes until softened.
    - Stir in the garlic and rosemary, cooking for another 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
3. **Combine the Ingredients**
    
    - Add the cooked wild rice blend to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables.
    - Stir in the dried cranberries, orange zest, thyme, and pecans (if using). Cook for 2–3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
    - Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. **Garnish and Serve**
    
    - Transfer the pilaf to a serving bowl and sprinkle with fresh parsley for a burst of color and freshness.
    - Serve warm as a flavorful side dish for holiday meals or any special occasion.
