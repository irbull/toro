#### **Instructions**

1. **Preheat Your Oven**  
    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) to ensure even baking.
    
2. **Prepare the Apple Filling**  
    In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples with granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Toss well to coat the apples evenly.
    
3. **Layer the Filling**  
    Spread the apple mixture evenly into a large (12-inch) cast iron skillet, ensuring a level surface for the topping.
    
4. **Make the Topping**  
    In a separate bowl, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work it into the mixture until it forms coarse crumbs.
    
5. **Assemble**  
    Sprinkle the topping evenly over the apple filling, making sure to cover the entire surface.
    
6. **Bake the Crisp**  
    Place the cast iron skillet in the preheated oven. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbling at the edges.
    
7. **Cool and Serve**  
    Allow the apple crisp to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Pair with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for the ultimate indulgence.
