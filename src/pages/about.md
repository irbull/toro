I am Software Engineer with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Math & Computer Science from the University of Waterloo and a PhD in Software Engineering from the University of Victoria. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Innoopract](https://innoopract.com/). I live in beautiful Victoria, BC, Canada with my family where I spend my evenings and weekends managing a [youth softball league](https://carnarvon.ca).

I am interested in all things software engineering, especially cloud architecture, cluster orchestration, software tools, languages & compilers, software design and artificial intelligence. My primary focus is on building highly productive teams and delivering high quality software.

I have studied software architecture, human computer interaction, program comprehension, software visualization, compilers, operating systems, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence. I have managed successful open-source projects and shipped quality software to millions of users.
